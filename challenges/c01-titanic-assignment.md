*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task
in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these
different variables. Unless we’re careful and thorough, we can easily
miss these patterns. In this challenge you’ll analyze a dataset with a
small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among
the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about
67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

``` r
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

    ## Rows: 32
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ Class    <chr> "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1s…
    ## $ Sex      <chr> "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female",…
    ## $ Age      <chr> "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child"…
    ## $ Survived <chr> "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "…
    ## $ n        <dbl> 0, 0, 35, 0, 0, 0, 17, 0, 118, 154, 387, 670, 4, 13, 89, 3, 5…

**Observations**:

The variables in this dateset are: Class: whether the person was 1st
class, 2nd class, 3rd class, or a crew member on the titanic Sex of the
person Age: whethere they were a child or an adult Survived: if they
survived the titanic or not n: the number of people in that specific
group

### **q2** Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of souls aboard. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1  2201

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here

- Are there any differences?

  - (Your response here)

- If yes, what might account for those differences?

  The wikipedia article lists that a total of 2224 people were on-board
  the titanic. 1517 would die in the ship sinking, while 704 people
  survived. The date set we are given lists a total of 2201 people,
  which is fairly close to wikipedia estimate of total people. There are
  a few possible reasons for this discrepancy. The first being that
  perhaps certain records may have been lost over time. Another reason
  could be that their families requested that this information be kept
  anonymous. Since, the difference between the size of this data set and
  number of officially recorded passengers we can probably be fairly
  confident in the data.

  - …

### **q3** Create a plot showing the count of persons who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

``` r
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
df_titanic %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Class, y = n, fill = Sex))
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

From looking at this graph, it is shown that among the passengers more
females survived than males. However, among the crew the survivors were
almost entirely male. It’s hard to know if this was due to the crew was
predominately male or because the male crew were more eager to secure
spots in the lifeboats, since the graph doesn’t show the breakdown of
people that didn’t survive. The same is true of the passengers. It is
hard to analyze the data, since we don’t know the percentages of males
and females in each group that survived.

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for
understanding differences between groups. This is because the
differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of
the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make
comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.\[1\]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age`
group.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 × 7
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n Total    Prop
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0     5   0    
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0    11   0    
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35    48   0.729
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0     1   0    
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0    13   0    
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17    31   0.548
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118   175   0.674
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154   168   0.917
    ## # … with 22 more rows

### **q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3. Is there anything *fishy* in your plot?

``` r
df_prop %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot()+
    geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex))
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`position_stack()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here.
- Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?

From looking at this chart, it looks like females did tend to survive at
higher rates than males. The largest proportion of survivors were from
first class, followed by second, and then third. Crew members had the
lowest survival rate, especially male crew members.

The “fishy” part of this plot if that the proportions are greater
than 1. This is due to the fact that in the calculation the proportions
are getting lumped together.

### **q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of occupants who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don’t forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider
additional variables!

``` r
df_prop %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(~ Age)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`position_stack()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

From looking at this data, it we can see that among adults females
survived at much higher rates than males. This difference is most
striking when looking at the proportion of males that survived in 2nd
class. Among children however, the breakdown is fairly even. Overall,
children survived at much higher rates than adults, especially if they
were in first or second class.

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

\[1\] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional
Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing
proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
